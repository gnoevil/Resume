Hi, my name is Geno and I believe we can improve our education with the proper
application of technology. I have mentored men and women and successfully lead them
to bigger and brighter futures by offering them perspective while in the Navy. I have
lead teams of sailors in high value projects with expertise in solving complex problems
in a dynamic environment. With a passion to find a solution that can target different
learning styles to help the student improve in a growth mindset environment. I have
20 years of leadership and team building soft skills from being a Veteran of the US Navy.
I plan on working with a team and company that shares my constant drive for education. My name
is Geno Guerrero, a software developer for hire.
